# Community of Practice

```admonish info
*Communities of Practice* are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.

The community acts as a **living curriculum** and involves **learning on the part of everyone**.
```

The aim of a *Community of Practice* (*CoP*) is to come together as a community and engage in a process of **collective learning** in a shared domain.
The [three characteristics](https://www.communityofpractice.ca/background/what-is-a-community-of-practice/) of a *CoP* are:

1. Community: An environment for learning through interaction;

2. Practice: Specific knowledge shared by community members; and

3. Domain: A shared interest, problem, or concern.

## Establishing a community

We are planning to organise a *Community of Practice* that is open to researchers who share an interest in **reproducible research and/or related topics and practices**.
This includes — but is not limited to — any interested persons across the
[SPECTRUM](https://www.spectrum.edu.au/) and [SPARK](https://www.spark.edu.au/) networks.

```admonish tip
No prior knowledge is required in order to participate.
You only need an interest in (collectively) improving how we develop our scientific code.
```

- We envision holding **monthly meetings**.
  Each meeting should be physically hosted by one or more community members, with online participation available to community members who cannot attend in person.

- In advance of each meeting, community members will be invited to propose a topic or discussion point to be the focus of the meeting.
  This may be an open question or challenge, an example of good research practices, a useful software tool, etc.

- We will summarise the key observations, findings, and outputs of each meeting in this section of [Git is my lab book](https://git-is-my-lab-book.net/).
  These notes will serve a resource for improving the existing materials and developing new content.

In this way, we will ensure that the community acts as a **living curriculum** and make this curriculum publicly available.

## Meeting times

```admonish note
The [World Clock Meeting Planner](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html) is helpful for scheduling meetings across multiple time zones.
```

We aim meet within **normal business hours** (9am-5pm) across the following time zones:

+ UTC+7: Western Indonesia, Thailand
+ UTC+8: Central Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Western Australia
+ UTC+9: Eastern Indonesia
+ UTC+9:30: Central Australia (no DST)
+ UTC+10: Eastern Australia (no DST)
+ UTC+12: New Zealand (no DST)

Daylight savings in Australia and New Zealand ends on 2 April 2023.
Relative to AEST (Eastern Australia) this means that meetings should start:

+ **No earlier than 12 noon** to accommodate Thailand and Indonesia; and
+ **No later than 2pm** to accommodate New Zealand.

Depending on participant availability, we may need to extend our window to 8am-6pm.
