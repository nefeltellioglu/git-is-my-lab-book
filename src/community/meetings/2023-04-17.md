# 17 April 2023

This is our initial meeting.
The goal is to welcome people to the community and outline how we envision running these Community of Practice meetings.

## Introductions

Introduce each participant in turn.

## Theme: Reproducible Research

Outline the theme and scope for this community.

This is open to all researchers who share an interest in reproducible research and/or related topics and practices; **no prior knowledge is required**.

Reproducible Research is a very broad topic.
For example, consider these questions:

- Can someone else reproduce your current results?

- Can someone else reproduce your current results without your help?

- Can you reproduce your own results from, say, 2 years ago?

- Can someone else reproduce your own results from, say, 2 years ago?

- Can you fix a mistake and update your own results from, say, 2 years ago?

## Describe how these meetings will run

- Aim to hold these meetings on a (roughly) monthly basis.

- Prior to each meeting, we will invite community members to propose a topic or discussion point to be the focus of the meeting. This may be an open question or challenge, an example of good research practices, a useful software tool, etc.

- Schedule each meeting to best suit the availability of community members who are particularly interested in the chosen topic.

- Each meeting should be hosted by one or more community members, with online participation available to those who cannot attend in person.

- At the end of each meeting, we will ask attendees how useful/effective they found the meeting, so that we can better cater to the needs of the community.
  For example:

  - What do you think of the session?
  - What did we do well?
  - What could we do better in the next session?

- We will summarise the key observations, findings, and outputs of each meeting in our online materials, and use them to improve and grow our training materials.

## Preferred communication channels

How do community members prefer to be contacted?

- One option is a [dedicated mailing list](https://lists.unimelb.edu.au/info/reproducible-research-cop).

## Supporting activities and resources

Are there other activities that we could organise to help support the community?

- [Git is my lab book](https://git-is-my-lab-book.net/)

- [SPECTRUM/SPARK peer review team](https://github.com/orgs/spectrum-spark/teams/peer-review)

## Topics for future meetings

Solicit suggestions for topics, themes, challenges, showcases, etc, for future meetings.
