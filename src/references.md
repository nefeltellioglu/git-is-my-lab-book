## Education and commentary articles

- [A Beginner's Guide to Conducting Reproducible Research](https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1801) describes key requirements for producing reproducible research outputs.

- [Point of View: How open science helps researchers succeed](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16800) presents evidence that open research practices bring significant benefits to researchers.

- [A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424) suggests an approach for structuring a computational research repository.

## Using Git and other software tools

- NDP Software have created [an interactive Git cheat-sheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html) that shows how git commands interact with the local and upstream repositories, and provides brief documentation for many common examples.

- The Pro Git book is [available online](https://git-scm.com/book).
  It starts with an overview of Git basics and then covers every aspect of Git in great detail.

- The Software Carpentry Foundation publishes [many lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), including [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

- [A Quick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668) provides a short guide to using Git and GitHub.
  It presents an example of analysing publicly available ChIP-seq data with Python.
  The repository for the article is also [publicly available](https://github.com/jdblischak/git-for-science).
