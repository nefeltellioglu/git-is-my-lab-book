# What should I commit?

A commit should represent a **unit of work**.

If you've made changes that represent multiple units of work (e.g., changing how input data are processed, and adding a new model parameter) these should be saved as separate commits.

Try describing out loud the changes you have made, and if you find yourself saying something like "I did X and Y and Z", then the changes should probably divided into multiple commits.

A helpful guideline is "**commit early, commit often**".

## Commit early

- Don't delay creating a commit because "it's not ready yet".

- A commit doesn't have to be "perfect".

## Commit often

- Small, focused commits are **extremely helpful** when trying to identify the cause of an unintended change in your code's behaviour or output.

- There is no such thing as too many commits.
