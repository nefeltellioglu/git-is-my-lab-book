# Orientation

One of [our goals for 2024](../community/meetings/2024-02-19.md#orientation-materials) is to develop orientation materials for new students, postdocs, etc.
There was broad interest in having a checklist, and example workflows for people to follow â€” particularly for projects that involve some form of code "hand over", to ensure that the recipients experience few problems in running the code themselves.

    If you to contribute content, please fork [the repository](https://github.com/robmoss/git-is-my-lab-book), add your contributions, and create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Suggested topics included:

- How to set up common tools on your laptop (e.g., Python and R);
- How to [organise your files](../guides/using-git/how-to-structure-a-repository.md);
- How to write Markdown documents (see Nick Tierney's book [RMarkdown for Scientists](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/));

- How to set up git [on your own device](../guides/using-git/README.md) and [using platforms such as GitHub](../guides/collaborating/README.md);
- How to recover [old versions of files](../guides/using-git/inspecting-your-history.md);
- How to make your code device-agnostic, so it can run on HPC platforms, virtual machines, and can easily be migrated to new devices; and
- How to plan for reproducibility from the beginning, rather than waiting until you're preparing a publication.

!!! note

    In addition to the topical guides, the [Useful resources](../guides/resources.md) section includes:

    - [A beginner's guide](../guides/resources.md#education-and-commentary-articles) to conducting reproducible research;
