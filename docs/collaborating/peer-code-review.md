# Peer code review

Once you're comfortable in using [merge/pull requests](merge-pull-requests.md) to review changes in a branch, you can use this approach for peer code review.

!!! info

    Remember that code review is a **discussion and critique** of a person's work.
    The code author will naturally feel that they own the code, and the reviewer needs to respect this.

For further advice and suggestions on how to conduct peer code review, please see the [Performing peer code review](../references.md#performing-peer-code-review) references.

!!! tip

    Mention people who have reviewed your code in the acknowledgements section of the paper.

## Define the goals of a peer review

In creating a pull request and inviting someone to review your work, the pull request description should include the following details:

- An overview of the work included in the pull request: what have you done, why have you done it?

- You may also want to explain how this work fits into the broader context of your research project.

- Identify **specific questions or tasks** that you would like the reviewer to address.
  For example, you might ask the reviewer to address one or more of the following questions:

  - Can the reviewer run your code and reproduce the outputs?

  - Is the code easy to understand?

  - If you have a [style guide](coding-style-guides.md), is the code formatted appropriately?

  - Do the model equation or data analysis steps seem sensible?

  - If you have written documentation, is it easy to understand?

  - Can the reviewer suggest how to improve or rewrite a specific piece of code?

!!! tip

    Make the reviewer's job easier by giving them small amounts of code to review.

## Finding a reviewer

On GitHub we have started a [peer-review team](https://github.com/orgs/spectrum-spark/teams/peer-review).
We encourage you to post on the discussion board, to find like-minded members to review your code.

## Guidelines for reviewing other people's code

Peer code review is an opportunity for the author and the reviewer to **learn from each other** and improve a piece of code.

!!! tip

    The most important guideline for the reviewer is to **be kind**.

    Treat other people's code the way you would want them to treat your code.

- [**Avoid saying "you"**](https://www.alexandra-hill.com/2018/06/25/the-art-of-giving-and-receiving-code-reviews/).
  Instead, say "we" or make the code the subject of the sentence.

  - Don't say "You don't have a test for this function", but instead say "We should test this function".

  - Don't say "Why did you write it this way?", but instead say "What are the advantages of this approach?".

- **Ask questions** rather than stating criticisms.

  - Don't say "This code is unclear", but instead say "Can you help me understand how this code works?".

- Treat peer review as an opportunity to **praise good work**!

  - Don't be afraid to tell the author that a piece of code was very clear, easy to understand, or well written.

  - Tell the author if reading their code made you aware of a useful function or package.

  - Tell the author if reading their code gave you some ideas for your own code.

## Complete the review

Once the peer code review is complete, and any corresponding updates to the code have been made, you can [merge the branch](merge-pull-requests.md).

## Retain a record of the review

By using merge/pull requests to review code, the discussion between the author and the reviewer is recorded.
This can be a useful reference for future code reviews.

!!! tip

    Try to record all of the discussion in the pull request comments, even if the author and reviewer meet in person, so that you have a complete record of the review.
