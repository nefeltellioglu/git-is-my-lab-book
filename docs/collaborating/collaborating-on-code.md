# Collaborating on code

Once you are comfortable with creating commits, working in branches, and merging branches, you can use these skills to **write code collaboratively as a team**.

The precise workflow will depend on the nature of your research and on the collaborators in your team, but there are some general guidelines that you may find helpful:

- Agree on a [style guide](coding-style-guides.md).

- Work on separate features in [separate branches](sharing-a-branch.md).

- Use [peer code review](peer-code-review.md) before merging changes from these branches.

- Consider using [continuous integration](continuous-integration.md) to:

  - Run [test cases](../testing/README.md) and detect bugs as early as possible; and
  - Verify that code meets your chosen style guide.
