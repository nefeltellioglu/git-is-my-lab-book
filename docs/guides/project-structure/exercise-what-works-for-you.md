# Exercise: what works for you?

Look back at your past projects and identify aspects of their structure that you have found helpful.

- What features or choices have worked well in past projects and might help you structure your future projects?

- What problems or issues have you experienced with the structure of your past projects, which you could avoid in your future projects?

- Can any of your colleagues and collaborators share similar insights?
