# Project structure

How we choose to structure a project can affect how readily someone else — or even yourself, after a period of absence — can understand, use, and extend the work.

!!! question

    Have you ever looked at your old code and wondered how it worked or how to make it run?

!!! tip

    A good project structure can serve as a table of contents and help the reader to navigate.

In an earlier section we provided some guidelines for [how to structure a repository](../using-git/how-to-structure-a-repository.md).
In this section we present further guidelines and examples to help you choose a sensible structure for your current project and future projects.

This includes high-level recommendations that should apply to any project, and more detailed recommendations that may be specific to a particular type of project or choice of programming language.
