# Exercise: a good README

Remember that the README file (usually one of `README.md`, `README.rst`, or `README.txt`) is often **the very first thing** that a user will see when looking at your project.

- Have you seen any README files that were particularly helpful, or were not very helpful?

- What information do you find helpful in a README file?

Consider the `README.md` file in the [Australian 2020 COVID-19 forecasts repository](https://gitlab.unimelb.edu.au/rgmoss/aus-2020-covid-forecasts).

- What content, if any, would you **add** to this file?

- What content, if any, would you **remove** from this file?

- Would you change its structure in any way?
