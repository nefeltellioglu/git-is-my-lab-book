# Coding style guides

A style guide defines rules and guidelines for how to structure and format your code.
This can make code **easier to write**, because you don't need to worry about how to format your code.
It can also make code **easier to read**, because consistent styling allows you to focus on the content.

There are two types of tools that can help you use a style guide:

- A **formatter** formats your code to make it consistent with a specific style; and

- A **linter** checks whether your code is consistent with a specific style.

## Recommended style guides

Because programming languages can be very different from each other, style guides are usually defined for a single programming language.

Here we list some of the most widely-used style guides for several common programming languages:

- For R there is a [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
  - You can apply this style to your code with [styler](http://styler.r-lib.org/).
  - You can check that your code conforms to this style with [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr).

- For Python there is [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/), which defines a coding style and applies this style to your code.

- For C++ there is a [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
