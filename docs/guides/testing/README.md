# Testing

This section introduces the topic of software testing.
Testing your code is an important part of any code-based research activity.
Tests check whether your code behaves as intended, and can warn you if you introduce a bug or mistake into your code.

!!! tip

    Tests can show the presence of bugs, but **not** their absence.
