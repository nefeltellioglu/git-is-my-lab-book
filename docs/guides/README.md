# Topical guides

These materials are divided into the following sections:

1. Understanding [version control](./version-control/README.md), which provides you with a complete and annotated history of your work, and with powerful ways to search and examine this history.

2. Learning to use [Git](./using-git/README.md), the most widely used version control system, which is the foundation of popular code-hosting services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/public), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

3. Using Git to [collaborate with colleagues](./collaborating/README.md) in a precisely controlled and manageable way.

4. Ensuring that your research is [reproducible by others](./reproducibility/README.md).

5. Using [testing frameworks](./testing/README.md) to verify that your code behaves as intended, and to automatically detect when you introduce a bug or mistake into your code.

6. Running your code on various [computing platforms]() that allow you to obtain results efficiently and without relying on your own laptop/computer.
