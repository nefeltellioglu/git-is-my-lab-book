# What is a commit?

A "commit" is a set of changes to one or more files in a repository.
These changes can include:

- Adding lines to a file;
- Removing lines from a file;
- Changing lines in a file;
- Adding new files; and
- Deleting existing files.

Each commit also includes the date and time that it was created, the user that created it, and a [commit message](how-do-I-write-a-commit-message.md).
