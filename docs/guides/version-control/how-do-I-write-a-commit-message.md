# How do I write a commit message?

Commit messages are shown as part of the repository history (e.g., when running `git log`).
Each message consists of a short one-line description, followed by as much or as little text as required.

You should treat these messages as **entries in a log book**.
Explain what changes were made and **why** they were made.
This can help collaborators understand what we have done, but more importantly is acts as a record for our future selves.

    Have you ever looked at code you wrote a long time ago *and wondered what you were thinking?*

    A history of detailed commit messages should allow you to answer this question!

    Remember that **code is harder to read than it is to write** ([Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)).

For example, rather than writing:

> Added model

You could write something like:

> Implemented the initial model
>
> This model includes all of the core features that we need to fit the data,
> but there several other features that we intend to add:
>
> \- Parameter X is currently constant, but we may need to allow it to vary
>   over time;
>
> \- Parameter Y should probably be a hyperparameter; and
>
> \- The population includes age-structured mixing, but we need to also include
>   age-specific outcomes, even though there is very little data to suggest
>   what the age effects might be.
