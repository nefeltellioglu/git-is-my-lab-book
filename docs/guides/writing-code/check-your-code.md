# Check your code

A "linter" is a tool that checks your code for syntax errors, possible mistakes, inconsistent formatting, and other potential issues.

We **strongly recommend** using an editor that displays linter warnings as you write your code.
Having instant feedback allows you to rapidly resolve many common issues and substantially improve your code.

We list here some of the most commonly used linters:

- **R:** [lintr](https://lintr.r-lib.org/)

- **Python:** [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)

- **Julia:** [Lint.jl](https://lintjl.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)
