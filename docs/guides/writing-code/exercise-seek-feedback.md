# Exercise: seek feedback

!!! question

    One goal to keep in mind is to ensure your work is **conceptually accessible**: how readily could someone else (or even yourself, after a period of absence) understand your code?

- Seek feedback on some code that you are **currently writing** â€” before the code is "finished".
  You may want to refer to our [peer code review guidelines](../collaborating/peer-code-review.md) and consider [what you want to learn](how-we-learn-to-write-code.md).
