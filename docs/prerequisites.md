# Prerequisites

These materials assume that the reader has a basic knowledge of the Bash command-line shell and using SSH to connect to remote computers.
You should be comfortable with using the command-line to perform the following tasks:

- Navigate your files and directories;
- Create, copy, move, and delete files and directories; and
- Work remotely using SSH.

Please refer to the following materials for further details:

- [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/): an introduction to using Bash.
- [Extra Unix Shell Material](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-extras/): additional shell lessons, including SSH.

!!! info

    If you use Windows, you may want to use PowerShell instead of Bash, in which case please refer to this [Introduction to the Windows Command Line with Powershell](https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0054).

Some chapters also assume that the reader has an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and has [added an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to their account.
