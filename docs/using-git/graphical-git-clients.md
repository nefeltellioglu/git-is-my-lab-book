# Graphical Git clients

While Git is a command-line program, there are other ways to work with Git repositories:

- There are many [graphical clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) that you can download and use;

- Many editors include Git support (e.g., [Atom](https://atom.io/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)); and

- Online platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/public), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) also provide a graphical interface for common Git actions.

In this book we will primarily show how to use Git **from the command-line**, but all of the concepts and terminology should also apply to all of the tools described above.
If you don't have Git already installed on your computer, see these [instructions for installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
