# Effective use of git

This section shows how to use the `git` command-line program to record your work, to inspect your commit history, and to search this commit history to identify commits that make specific changes or have specific effects.

!!! tip "Reminder"

    Remember to [commit early and commit often](../version-control/what-should-I-commit.md).
    **Do not wait** until your code is "perfect".
